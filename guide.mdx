## Creating and Editing Pages

Start by creating pages to structure your documentation. Use the editor for Markdown and MDX syntax, including components like `<Callout>` for highlights.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a New Page" icon="plus">
    Navigate to your workspace. Click **New Page** and select a parent folder.

    Choose a title like `api-reference.mdx`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Edit Content" icon="edit-3">
    Use the visual editor or switch to source mode. Add frontmatter:

````markdown
```yaml
---
title: API Reference
description: Endpoint details and examples.
---
```
````
  </Step>
  <Step title="Preview and Publish" icon="eye">
    Preview changes in real-time. Click **Publish** to make live.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Embed code examples directly:

<CodeGroup tabs="JavaScript,Python">
```javascript
async function fetchUser(id) {
  const response = await fetch(`/api/users/${id}`);
  return response.json();
}
```
```python
import requests

def fetch_user(id):
    response = requests.get(f'/api/users/{id}')
    return response.json()
```
</CodeGroup>

<Callout kind="tip">
  Always escape special characters like `{variable}` or `<100ms` with backticks in prose to prevent parsing errors.
</Callout>

## Collaboration Workflows

Invite team members and manage permissions. Workflows support real-time edits and version history.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Editor Role" icon="edit">
    Edit pages directly. Use inline comments for feedback.

    ```bash
    git pull origin main
    # Make changes
    git commit -m "Update API docs"
    git push
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Reviewer Role" icon="eye">
    Review drafts. Approve or request changes via `@mentions`.

    Track changes in the history panel.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Admin Role" icon="shield">
    Manage permissions and workspaces. Set role-based access.

    | Permission | Editor | Reviewer | Admin |
    |------------|--------|----------|-------|
    | Edit      | Yes    | No       | Yes   |
    | Publish   | No     | Yes      | Yes   |
    | Delete    | No     | No       | Yes   |
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Search and Organization Tools

Keep docs organized with tags, hierarchies, and advanced search.

### Tagging and Hierarchies
Assign tags like `api`, `guide` during creation. Nest pages under folders for structure.

### Search Features
Use full-text search across all pages. Filter by tags or date.

<ExpandableGroup>
  <Expandable title="Advanced Search Syntax" default-open="false">
    Search with operators:

    - `title:API` - Matches page titles
    - `tag:feature` - Filters by tags
    - `"exact phrase"` - Phrase search

    Example: `api AND status:published`
  </Expandable>
</ExpandableGroup>

<Callout kind="success">
  Regularly audit tags to maintain organization. Aim for `<20` tags per workspace.
</Callout>

With these tools, you efficiently manage growing documentation. Integrate feedback loops and search to keep content fresh and accessible.
